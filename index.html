            <h3>What is involved in styling text in CSS?</h3>
            <article>
                <p>As you'll have already experienced in your work with HTML and CSS, text inside an element is laid
                    out
                    inside the element's content box. It starts at the top left of the content area (or the top right,
                    in the case of RTL language content), and flows towards the end of the line. Once it reaches the
                    end, it goes down to the next line and continues, then the next line, until all the content has been
                    placed in the box. Text content effectively behaves like a series of inline elements, being laid out
                    on lines adjacent to one another, and not creating line breaks until the end of the line is reached,
                    or unless you force a line break manually using the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element.
                </p>
                <p>The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two categories, which we'll look at
                    separately in this article: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Font styles</strong>: Properties that affect the font that is applied to the text,
                        affecting
                        what font is applied, how big it is, whether it is bold, italic, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Text layout styles</strong>: Properties that affect the spacing and other layout
                        features of
                        the text, allowing manipulation of, for example, the space between lines and letters, and
                        how the text is aligned within the content box.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="note">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Bear in mind that the text inside an element is all affected as one single
                    entity. You can't
                    select and style subsections of text unless you wrap them in an appropriate element (such as a
                    <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>), or use a text-specific pseudo-element
                    like
                    ::first-letter (selects the first
                    letter of an element's text), ::first-line (selects the first line of an element's text), or
                    ::selection (selects the text currently highlighted by the cursor).
                </aside>

            <h3>Fonts</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Let's move straight on to look at properties for styling fonts. In this example we'll apply some
                    different CSS properties to the same HTML sample, which looks like this:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        &lt;h1&gt;Tommy the cat&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
                        <br>
                        &lt;p&gt;Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...&lt;/p&gt; <br>
                        <br>
                        &lt;p&gt;Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
                        may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat
                        had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
                        this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban
                        predator — Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare
                        occasion such as this that he did.&lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                </div>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Color">
            <h4>Color</h4>
            <article>
                <p>The <code>color</code> property sets the color of the foreground content of the selected elements
                    (which is
                    usually
                    the text, but can also include a couple of other things, such as an underline or overline placed on
                    text
                    using the <code>text-decoration</code> property).</p>
                <p><code>color</code> can accept any CSS color unit, for example:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>p { <br>
                        color: red; <br>
                        }</code>
                </div>
                <p>This will cause the paragraphs to become red, rather than the standard browser default black, like
                    so:</p>
                <div class="result">
                    <h1>Tommy the cat</h1>

                    <p>Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...</p>

                    <p>Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
                        may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat
                        had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
                        this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban
                        predator — Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare
                        occasion such as this that he did.</p>
                </div>

        <section class="main-section" id="Font_families">
            <article>
                <h4>Font families</h4>
                <p>To set a different font on your text, you use the <code>font-family</code> property — this allows you
                    to specify a
                    font (or list of fonts) for the browser to apply to the selected elements. The browser will only
                    apply a
                    font if it is available on the machine the website is being accessed on; if not, it will just use a
                    browser default font. A simple example looks like so:</p>
                <div class="code"><code>p { <br>
                        font-family: arial; <br>
                        }</code></div>
                <p>This would make all paragraphs on a page adopt the arial font, which is found on any computer.</p>
                <div class="section__inner">
                    <h6>Web safe fonts</h6>
                    <p>Speaking of font availability, there are only a certain number of fonts that are generally
                        available across all systems and can therefore be used without much worry. These are the
                        so-called web safe fonts.

                        Most of the time, as web developers we want to have more specific control over the fonts used to
                        display our text content. The problem is to find a way to know which font is available on the
                        computer used to see our web pages. There is no way to know this in every case, but the web safe
                        fonts are known to be available on nearly all instances of the most used operating systems
                        (Windows, macOS, the most common Linux distributions, Android, and iOS).

                        The list of actual web safe fonts will change as operating systems evolve, but it's reasonable
                        to consider the following fonts web safe, at least for now (many of them have been popularized
                        thanks to the Microsoft Core fonts for the Web initiative in the late 90s and early 2000s):</p>
