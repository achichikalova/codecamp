                <h2>What is involved in styling text in CSS?</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>As you'll have already experienced in your work with HTML and CSS, text inside an element is laid
                    out
                    inside the element's content box. It starts at the top left of the content area (or the top right,
                    in the case of RTL language content), and flows towards the end of the line. Once it reaches the
                    end, it goes down to the next line and continues, then the next line, until all the content has been
                    placed in the box. Text content effectively behaves like a series of inline elements, being laid out
                    on lines adjacent to one another, and not creating line breaks until the end of the line is reached,
                    or unless you force a line break manually using the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element.
                </p>
                <p>The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two categories, which we'll look at
                    separately in this article: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Font styles</strong>: Properties that affect the font that is applied to the text,
                        affecting
                        what font is applied, how big it is, whether it is bold, italic, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Text layout styles</strong>: Properties that affect the spacing and other layout
                        features of
                        the text, allowing manipulation of, for example, the space between lines and letters, and
                        how the text is aligned within the content box.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="note">
                    <strong><strong>Note:</strong>:</strong> Bear in mind that the text inside an element is all
                    affected as one single
                    entity. You can't
                    select and style subsections of text unless you wrap them in an appropriate element (such as a
                    <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>), or use a text-specific pseudo-element
                    like
                    ::first-letter (selects the first
                    letter of an element's text), ::first-line (selects the first line of an element's text), or
                    ::selection (selects the text currently highlighted by the cursor).

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Let's move straight on to look at properties for styling fonts. In this example we'll apply some
                    different CSS properties to the same HTML sample, which looks like this:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        &lt;h1&gt;Tommy the cat&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
                        <br>
                        &lt;p&gt;Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...&lt;/p&gt; <br>
                        <br>
                        &lt;p&gt;Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
                        may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat
                        had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
                        this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban
                        predator — Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare
                        occasion such as this that he did.&lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                </div>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Color">
            <header>
                <h4>Color</h4>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>The <code>color</code> property sets the color of the foreground content of the selected elements
                    (which is
                    usually
                    the text, but can also include a couple of other things, such as an underline or overline placed on
                    text
                    using the <code>text-decoration</code> property).</p>
                <p><code>color</code> can accept any CSS color unit, for example:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>p { <br>
                        color: red; <br>
                        }</code>
                </div>
                <p>This will cause the paragraphs to become red, rather than the standard browser default black, like
                    so:</p>
                <div class="result">
                    <h1>Tommy the cat</h1>

                    <p>Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...</p>

                    <p>Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
                        may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat
                        had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
                        this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban
                        predator — Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare
                        occasion such as this that he did.</p>
                </div>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Font_families">
            <header>
                <h4>Font families</h4>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>To set a different font on your text, you use the <code>font-family</code> property — this allows you
                    to specify a
                    font (or list of fonts) for the browser to apply to the selected elements. The browser will only
                    apply a
                    font if it is available on the machine the website is being accessed on; if not, it will just use a
                    browser default font. A simple example looks like so:</p>
                <div class="code"><code>p { <br>
                        font-family: arial; <br>
                        }</code></div>
                <p>This would make all paragraphs on a page adopt the arial font, which is found on any computer.</p>
                <div class="section__inner">
                    <h6>Web safe fonts</h6>
                    <p>Speaking of font availability, there are only a certain number of fonts that are generally
                        available across all systems and can therefore be used without much worry. These are the
                        so-called web safe fonts.

                        Most of the time, as web developers we want to have more specific control over the fonts used to
                        display our text content. The problem is to find a way to know which font is available on the
                        computer used to see our web pages. There is no way to know this in every case, but the web safe
                        fonts are known to be available on nearly all instances of the most used operating systems
                        (Windows, macOS, the most common Linux distributions, Android, and iOS).

                        The list of actual web safe fonts will change as operating systems evolve, but it's reasonable
                        to consider the following fonts web safe, at least for now (many of them have been popularized
                        thanks to the Microsoft Core fonts for the Web initiative in the late 90s and early 2000s):</p>

                    <h6>Default fonts</h6>
                    <p>CSS defines five generic names for fonts: <code>serif</code>, <code>sans-serif</code>,
                        <code>monospace</code>, <code>cursive</code> and
                        <code>fantasy</code>.
                        Those are very generic and the exact font face used when using those generic names is up to each
                        browser and can vary for each operating system they are running on. It represents a <em>worst
                            case scenario</em> where the browser will try to do its best to provide at least a font that
                        looks appropriate. <code>serif</code>, <code>sans-serif</code> and <code>monospace</code> are
                        quite predictable and should provide something
                        reasonable. On the other hand, <code>cursive</code> and <code>fantasy</code> are less
                        predictable and we recommend using
                        them very carefully, testing as you go.</p>
                    <p>The five names are defined as follows:</p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Term</th>
                            <th>Definition</th>
                            <th>Example</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>serif</td>
                            <td>Fonts that have serifs (the flourishes and other small details you see at the ends of
                                the strokes in some typefaces)</td>
                            <td style="font-family: serif;">My big red elephant</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>sans-serif</td>
                            <td>Fonts that don't have serifs.</td>
                            <td style="font-family: sans-serif;">My big red elephant</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>monospace</td>
                            <td>Fonts where every character has the same width, typically used in code listings.</td>
                            <td style="font-family: monospace;">My big red elephant</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>cursive</td>
                            <td>Fonts that are intended to emulate handwriting, with flowing, connected strokes.</td>
                            <td style="font-family: cursive;">My big red elephant</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>fantasy</td>
                            <td>Fonts that are intended to be decorative.</td>
                            <td style="font-family: fantasy;">My big red elephant</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <h6>Font stacks</h6>
                    <p>Since you can't guarantee the availability of the fonts you want to use on your webpages (even a
                        web font <em>could</em> fail for some reason), you can supply a <strong>font stack</strong> so
                        that the browser has
                        multiple fonts it can choose from. This simply involves a <code>font-family</code> value
                        consisting of
                        multiple font names separated by commas, e.g.</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <code>p { <br>
                            font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, sans-serif; <br>
                            }</code>
                    </div>
                    <p>In such a case, the browser starts at the beginning of the list and looks to see if that font is
                        available on the machine. If it is, it applies that font to the selected elements. If not, it
                        moves on to the next font, and so on.</p>
                    <p>It is a good idea to provide a suitable generic font name at the end of the stack so that if none
                        of the listed fonts are available, the browser can at least provide something approximately
                        suitable. To emphasise this point, paragraphs are given the browser's default serif font if no
                        other option is available — which is usually Times New Roman — this is no good for a sans-serif
                        font!</p>
                    <aside class="note">
                        <strong>Note:</strong>: Font names that have more than one word — like <code>Trebuchet MS</code>
                        — need to be
                        surrounded by
                        quotes, for example <code>"Trebuchet MS"</code>.
                    </aside>
                    <h6>A font-family example</h6>
                    <p>Let's add to our previous example, giving the paragraphs a sans-serif font:</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <code>p { <br>
                            color: red; <br>
                            font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; <br>
                            }</code>
                    </div>
                    <p>This gives us the following result:</p>
                    <div class="result" style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">
                        <h1>Tommy the cat</h1>

                        <p>Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...</p>

                <h4>Font size</h4>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>In our previous module's CSS values and units article, we reviewed length and size units. Font size
                    (set with the <code>font-size</code> property) can take values measured in most of these units (and
                    others, such
                    as percentages), however the most common units you'll use to size text are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>px</code> (pixels): The number of pixels high you want the text to be. This is an absolute
                        unit — it
                        results in the same final computed value for the font on the page in pretty much any situation.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>ems</code>: 1 <code>em</code> is equal to the font size set on the parent element of the
                        current element we are
                        styling (more specifically, the width of a capital letter M contained inside the parent
                        element.) This can become tricky to work out if you have a lot of nested elements with different
                        font sizes set, but it is doable, as you'll see below. Why bother? It is quite natural once you
                        get used to it, and you can use <code>em</code> to size everything, not just text. You can have
                        an entire
                        website sized using <code>em</code>, which makes maintenance easy.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>rems</code>: These work just like <code>em</code>, except that 1 <code>rem</code> is equal
                        to the font size set on the root
                        element of the document (i.e. <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>), not the parent element. This makes
                        doing
                        the maths to
                        work out your font sizes much easier, although if you want to support really old browsers, you
                        might struggle — <code>rem</code> is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and below.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <code>font-size</code> of an element is inherited from that element's parent element. This all
                    starts with the
                    root element of the entire document — <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> — the <code>font-size</code> of
                    which
                    is set to
                    16 <code>px</code> as standard
                    across browsers. Any paragraph (or another element that doesn't have a different size set by the
                    browser) inside the root element will have a final size of 16 <code>px</code>. Other elements may
                    have different
                    default sizes, for example an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element has a size of 2 <code>em</code> set by
                    default, so it
                    will have a final size of 32 <code>px</code>.
                </p>
                <p>Things become more tricky when you start altering the font size of nested elements. For example, if
                    you had an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element in your page, and set its <code>font-size</code> to
                    1.5 <code>em</code> (which would compute to
                    24 <code>px</code> final size), and then wanted the paragraphs inside the
                    <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>
                    elements to have a
                    computed font size of 20 <code>px</code>, what <code>em</code> value would you use?
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        <span>&lt;!-- document base font-size is 16px --&gt;</span> <br>
                        &lt;article&gt; <span>&lt;!-- If my font-size is 1.5em --&gt;</span> <br>
                        &lt;p&gt;My paragraph&lt;/p&gt; <span>&lt;!-- How do I compute to 20px font-size? --&gt;</span>
                        <br>
                        &lt;/article&gt;
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>You would need to set its <code>em</code> value to 20/24, or 0.83333333 <code>em</code>. The maths
                    can be complicated, so you
                    need to be careful about how you style things. It is best to use <code>rem</code> where you can, to
                    keep things
                    simple, and avoid setting the font-size of container elements where possible.

                    <h6>A simple sizing example</h6>
                    <p>When sizing your text, it is usually a good idea to set the base font-size of the document to 10
                        px, so that then the maths is a lot easier to work out — required (r)em values are then the
                        pixel font size divided by 10, not 16. After doing that, you can easily size the different types
                        of text in your document to what you want. It is a good idea to list all your font-size rulesets
                        in a designated area in your stylesheet, so they are easy to find.
                    </p>

                <p>CSS provides four common properties to alter the visual weight/emphasis of text:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>font-style</code>: Used to turn italic text on and off. Possible values are as follows
                        (you'll rarely
                        use this, unless you want to turn some italic styling off for some reason):
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>normal</code>: Sets the text to the normal font (turns existing italics off.)</li>
                            <li><code>italic</code>: Sets the text to use the italic version of the font if available;
                                if not
                                available, it will simulate italics with oblique instead.</li>
                            <li><code>oblique</code>: Sets the text to use a simulated version of an italic font,
                                created by slanting
                                the normal version.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><code>font-weight</code>: Sets how bold the text is. This has many values available in case you
                        have many
                        font variants available (such as -light, -normal, -bold, -extrabold, -black, etc.), but
                        realistically you'll rarely use any of them except for <code>normal</code> and
                        <code>bold</code>:

                            <li><code>normal</code>, <code>bold</code>: Normal and bold font weight</li>
                            <li><code>lighter</code>, <code>bolder</code>: Sets the current element's boldness to be one
                                step lighter or heavier
                                than its parent element's boldness.</li>
                            <li><code>100</code>–<code>900</code>: Numeric boldness values that provide finer grained
                                control than the above
                                keywords, if needed. </li>

                    <li><code>text-transform</code>: Allows you to set your font to be transformed. Values include:

                            <li><code>none</code>: Prevents any transformation.</li>
                            <li><code>uppercase</code>: Transforms ALL TEXT TO CAPITALS.</li>

                                square, similar to
                                a monospace font, allowing aligning of e.g. Latin characters along with Asian language
                                glyphs (like Chinese, Japanese, Korean).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><code>text-decoration</code>: Sets/unsets text decorations on fonts (you'll mainly use this to
                        unset the
                        default underline on links when styling them.) Available values are:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>none</code>: Unsets any text decorations already present.</li>
                            <li><code>underline</code>: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Underlines the
                                    text.</span></li>
                            <li><code>overline</code>: <span style="text-decoration: overline;">Gives the text an
                                    overline.</span></li>
                            <li><code>line-through</code>: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Puts a
                                    strikethrough over the text.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>You should note that <code>text-decoration</code> can accept multiple values at once, if you want
                    to add
                    multiple
                    decorations simultaneously, for example <span
                        style="text-decoration: underline overline;"><code>text-decoration: underline
                            overline</code></span>. Also
                    note that
                    <code>text-decoration</code> is a shorthand property for <code>text-decoration-line</code>,
                    <code>text-decoration-style</code>, and
                    <code>text-decoration-color</code>. You can use combinations of these property values to create
                    interesting
                    effects, for example <span style="text-decoration: line-through red wavy;"><code>text-decoration:
                            line-through red
                            wavy</code></span>.</p>
                <p>Let's look at adding a couple of these properties to our example:</p>
                <p>Our new result is like so:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>

                        } <br>
                        <br>
                        h1 {<br>
                        font-size: 5rem;<br>

                        }<br>
                        <br>
                        h1 + p {<br>
                        font-weight: bold;<br>
                        }<br>

                <h4>Text drop shadows</h4>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>You can apply drop shadows to your text using the <code>text-shadow</code> property. This takes up to
                    four values,
                    as shown in the example below:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        text-shadow: 4px 4px 5px red;
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>The four properties are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The horizontal offset of the shadow from the original text — this can take most available CSS
                        length and size units, but you'll most commonly use <code>px</code>; positive values move the
                        shadow right,
                        and negative values left. This value has to be included.</li>
                    <li>The vertical offset of the shadow from the original text; behaves basically just like the
                        horizontal offset, except that it moves the shadow up/down, not left/right. This value has to be
                        included.</li>
                    <li>The blur radius — a higher value means the shadow is dispersed more widely. If this value is not
                        included, it defaults to 0, which means no blur. This can take most available CSS length and
                        size units.</li>
                    <li>The base color of the shadow, which can take any CSS color unit. If not included, it defaults to
                        <code>black</code>.</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="section__inner">
                    <h6>Multiple shadows</h6>
                    <p>You can apply multiple shadows to the same text by including multiple shadow values separated by
                        commas, for example:</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <code>
                            text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px red, <br>
                            2px 2px 1px red;
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>If we applied this to the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element in our Tommy the cat example, we'd end
                        up
                        with this:</p>
                    <div class="result">
                        <h1 style="font-size: 50px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px red,
                        2px 2px 1px red;">Tommy the cat</h1>

                        <p style="font-size: 15px;">Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...</p>
